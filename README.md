# Pentesting Playground
This contains the contents needed to deploy a home lab in VirtualBox. This is a work in progress following my series on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDrNMcTNhhYoEjHYs0ZBfcSE7Hw46BeTA).

This is meant to be a community driven project. I encourage suggestions for things to set up.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo by downloading the zip verision, or with `$ git clone https://github.com/C0nd4/pentesting-playground`

Download Packer [here](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html).

Place the Packer executable file inside of the <i>Packer</i> directory.

### Optional
You can download the iso files ahead of time in order to save some time doing multiple base installations. If you choose not to so this, the iso will be fetched for each build of a base VM. 

Download the Ubuntu 18.04 mini.iso from [here](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic-updates/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso)

Place the mini.iso inside of the <i>http</i> directory. Rename it to <i>ubuntu18-mini.iso</i>

------

## Building the Lab

1. First build the base OVFs with `$ packer build ubuntu18-base.json`

Repeat step 1 each base OVF type that you would like to use. 

2. Create an OVF from the base with a service with `$ packer build ubuntu-apache.json`

Repeat step 2 for each servuce OVF type that you would like to use. 

3. Import each OVA into VirtualBox. 
<b>Make sure to randomize the MAC addresses of each VM upon import</b>
