# Pentesting Playground
This contains the contents needed to deploy a home lab in VirtualBox. This is meant to be a community driven project. I encourage suggestions for things to set up.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo by downloading the zip verision, or with `$ git clone https://github.com/C0nd4/pentesting-playground`

Download Packer [here](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html).

Place the Packer executable file inside of the <i>pentesting-playground</i> directory, or in your PATH.

### Using the Lab Creator Tool
There is a graphical tool that will aide in creating multiple machines at the same time. This is a work in progress and an official stable version has not been released yet. Not all functionality is guarunteed to work, but hopefully most of it does. You can use this tool by invoking `python3 lab-creator.py`.

### Requirements

- Python 3
- VirtualBox
- Packer
- A NAT Network in VirtualBox names "NatNetwork"

## Roadmap
There are several ideas for features I'd like to add. 

[ ] Use Vagrant to handle networking instead of a NAT Network

[ ] Add more supported operating systems

[ ] Add more ansible roles

[ ] Add an Active Directory builder
