# Pentesting Playground
This contains the contents needed to deploy a home lab of Vagrant boxes, all from a simple to use GUI. This is meant to be a community driven project. I encourage suggestions for things to set up.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo by downloading the zip verision, or with `$ git clone https://github.com/C0nd4/pentesting-playground`

Download Packer [here](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html).

Place the Packer executable in your PATH.

Download and install Vagrant [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

### Using the Lab Creator Tool
There is a graphical tool that will aide in creating multiple machines at the same time. This is a work in progress and an official stable version has not been released yet. You can use this tool by invoking `python3 lab-creator.py`. The tool will render a Vagrantfile and Vagrant boxes in the `Vagrant` folder after hitting the `Run` button. Be sure to press `Save` after each machine is configured before running. Building the lab machines can take a while due to the need to build each VM with Packer. To start the lab, simply change into the `Vagrant` folder and enter the command `vagrant up`. 

### Requirements

- Python 3
- VirtualBox
- Packer
- Vagrant

## Roadmap
There are several ideas for features I'd like to add. 

[ ] Add an Active Directory builder

[ ] Add a config file

[ ] Add support for VMware

[ ] Allow users to add custom roles and operating systems

[ ] Add more supported operating systems

[ ] Add more ansible roles
